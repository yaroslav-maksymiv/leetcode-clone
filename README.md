# Leetcode Clone

### Description
This project is my clone of LeetCode. I built it using Django for the backend and React for the frontend. The most challenging part of this project was implementing infinite nested comments correctly. In the future, I hope to add the ability to submit solutions in languages other than JavaScript.
